# XMI_translator
This repository provides a simple yet effective pipeline to convert a SysML state machine—exported from Cameo in XMI format—into an executable Python agent for use in the Ingescape framework. The workflow is divided into two main translation steps, enabling rapid integration of model-based designs into Python-based applications.
